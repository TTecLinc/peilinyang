China’s pension system has been undergoing reformation these years. Fully funded pension is one of the direction that government explores to address the old-aging issues of China’s economy. Our main goal is to model the fully funded system and predict the shock response of that. For the sake of idiosyncratic incoming has different marginal propensity consumption(MPC), we build a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian(HANK) model, which can descript the relationship of incomes difference and pension assets allocation. We use an emprical model to verify the correlation to macro variables, and then construct the model to predict the effects of new pension system. As it turns out, technology shock has difference on these two regimes.
