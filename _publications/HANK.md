title: "Transmission Channels of Fiscal Policy at ZLB"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/HANK
excerpt: 'In the era of crisis (e.g. COVID-19), zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest
rates tend to bind, and monetary policy cannot provide appropriate stimulus. Fiscal policy is an appropriate stabilization tool at the ZLB. I build an analytical TANK model to understand how the fiscal policy tool will be transmitted to the agents. Consumption taxes and labor taxes replicate the effects of monetary policy through the intertemporal substitution channel. Debt-financed lumpsum transfers and a permanent increase in the government debt level replicate the effects of monetary policy through the redistribution channel. And I explore how to replicate similar results in the mechanism in the HANK framework.'

In the era of crisis (e.g. COVID-19), zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest
rates tend to bind, and monetary policy cannot provide appropriate stimulus. Fiscal policy is an appropriate stabilization tool at the ZLB. I build an analytical TANK model to understand how the fiscal policy tool will be transmitted to the agents. Consumption taxes and labor taxes replicate the effects of monetary policy through the intertemporal substitution channel. Debt-financed lumpsum transfers and a permanent increase in the government debt level replicate the effects of monetary policy through the redistribution channel. And I explore how to replicate similar results in the mechanism in the HANK framework.
