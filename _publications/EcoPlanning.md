excerpt: 'In order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and reduce potential deaths, most countries have
adopted lockdown policy. However, during lockdown period we found the market value of
website establishments still go up. In this paper, our primary goal is to explain how this
happen during lockdown. Based on workhorse SIR model, a heuristic single sector model is
introduced as a benchmark model to study the impact of lockdown on the whole economy. In
second part, we build a planning problem with industrial structure–online and offline sectors.
We show how lockdown policy will crowd out the offline sector and how that effect embodies
on macro variables.'
