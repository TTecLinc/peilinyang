## <medium> Rare Disaster Element in HANK </medium>

_2021, Peilin Yang_

<medium>The rare disaster factor has become a powerful factor explaining the mystery of equity premium. This paper studies a heterogeneous new Keynesian model (HANK) in which rare disaster pricing factors are nested. This factor can effectively explain the excess risk premium and business cycle, and I have made a detailed comparison with the representative New Keynesian model (RANK). It proves that due to the existence of heterogeneous marginal propensity to consume (MPC), HANK has greater volatility and explains more asset premiums. In other words, inequality in the economy will lead to greater economic fluctuations. </medium>
