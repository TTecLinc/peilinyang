Hello, I'm Peilin. My research interests are centered in macroeconomics, international economics and finance. 

Currently, I'm interested in topics:

1) Introduce cutting-edge statistics toolkit "Conformal Inference" into economics applications like policy evaluation, instrumental variables, and VAR;
2) How news intertwines with agents in the economy and identification of exogenous effect of news shock;
3) Macroprudential policy to solve demand externality of international financial arbitrage;
